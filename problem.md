# 📄 Problem Statement – deeplog-cli-nodejs

## 🧠 Overview

Modern operating systems like macOS generate vast amounts of system logs every minute. These logs contain rich data about system behavior, network activity, application performance, authentication, crashes, and more. However, these logs are:

- Difficult to navigate without GUI tools
- Lacking summarized insights
- Inaccessible to developers through simple CLI tooling

There is a need for a developer-focused, flexible, and intelligent CLI tool that can **fetch**, **filter**, **analyze**, and **summarize** macOS logs directly from the terminal.

---

## 🎯 Objective

`deeplog-cli-nodejs` aims to solve this problem by building a powerful, modular, and extensible **Node.js CLI application** that provides:

- 📦 Easy access to macOS logs via native tools like `log show` and `log stream`
- 🔍 On-demand filtering, searching, and querying of logs
- 📊 Summary reports of critical system events (errors, VPN usage, failed auth, etc.)
- 🚨 Real-time monitoring and alerting from live system events
- 🧩 Plugin support for custom parsing logic
- 📁 Export capabilities in JSON/Markdown/HTML

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Fetch system logs for past N minutes/hours
- Filter logs by subsystem, keywords, or time range
- Analyze and summarize patterns (top errors, frequency, source apps)
- Export logs and summaries to human-readable reports
- Watch real-time logs and trigger alerts on custom rules
- Designed for large-scale log files (10K+ lines)
- Built using modern Node.js features (streams, child_process, events, etc.)

---

## 👨‍💻 Users

- Developers debugging local macOS behavior
- Security enthusiasts tracking system anomalies
- Power users and system admins needing structured log insights

---

## 📌 Example Use Cases

```bash
# View all logs related to VPN failures in the last hour
deeplog fetch --filter vpn --range 1h

# Summarize top errors from logs
deeplog analyze logs/vpn.log --summary

# Watch logs in real-time for "unauthorized" or "crash" events
deeplog watch --alert-on unauthorized,crash

# Export selected logs as a markdown report
deeplog report logs/system.jsonl --format markdown
