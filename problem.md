# 📄 Problem Statement – deeplog-cli-nodejs

## 🧠 Overview

Modern operating systems like macOS generate vast amounts of system logs every minute. These logs contain rich data about system behavior, network activity, application performance, authentication, crashes, and more. However, these logs are:

- Difficult to navigate without GUI tools
- Lacking summarized insights
- Inaccessible to developers through simple CLI tooling

There is a need for a developer-focused, flexible, and intelligent CLI tool that can **fetch**, **filter**, **analyze**, and **summarize** macOS logs directly from the terminal.

---

## 🎯 Objective

`deeplog-cli-nodejs` aims to solve this problem by building a powerful, modular, and extensible **Node.js CLI application** that provides:

- 📦 Easy access to macOS logs via native tools like `log show` and `log stream`
- 🔍 On-demand filtering, searching, and querying of logs
- 📊 Summary reports of critical system events (errors, VPN usage, failed auth, etc.)
- 🧩 Plugin support for custom parsing logic
- 📁 Export capabilities in JSON/Markdown/HTML
